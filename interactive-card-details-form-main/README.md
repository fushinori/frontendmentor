## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Astro](https://astro.build/) - All-in-one web framework
- [CSS Modules](https://github.com/css-modules/css-modules/) - For styling components

### What I learned

This was my first time using React. I also used Astro instead of Next.js. Since all the components had state, I couldn't really use Astro components. However, I'm looking forward to making more projects with Astro since it was fun to work with.

### Continued development

I plan to work more with React and Astro as well as get better at CSS since there is still so much to learn.
