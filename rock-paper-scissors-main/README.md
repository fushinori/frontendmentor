## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Preact](https://preactjs.com/) - JS library
- [Astro](https://astro.build/) - All-in-one web framework
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

- Accessibility for modals
  - Trapping focus when modal is open.
  - Various aria attributes.

### Continued development

Accessibility is still something I'm not 100% adept in implementing. I'd like to learn more about it and focus on it in future projects.
